                        <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android

                            With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as 
                            well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React 
                            components: <span class="ital-font">bundles of reusable, nestable code.</span> 
                            You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how

                                 building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native,
                                  it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or
                                   can serve as a refresher course.

                                cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and 
                                a cafe to work in.</p>

                            <p><strong>+ JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets
                                 you write elements inside JavaScript like so:<mark> &lt;Text&gt;Hello, I 
                                    am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt; </mark>.</p>

                            <p>The React docs have <a href="#">a comprehensive guide to JSX</a> you can
                                refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables
                                 inside it. Here you are declaring a <mark>name</mark> for the cat, name, 
                                 and embedding it with curly braces inside<mark>&lt;Text&gt;</mark></p>

                            <p><strong>+ state.</strong> While you can think of props as arguments you use 
                                to configure how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal
                                 data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time
                                  or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

                        called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function

                         the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
